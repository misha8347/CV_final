## Description
This is our License Plate OCR project

## Navigation

1. "License plate OCR" file trains model to detect  
license plates on cars

2. "License plate number OCR" file trains another model to  recognize symbols on license plates (letters and digits)

3. Finally, "inference" file combines both models to process raw image to get license plate number

## Models

## How to reproduce our code?

1. Download "models", "models_number", and 2 zip files to the folder where all jupyter notebooks are stored

2. - If you want to use pretrained models, just start "license plate OCR inference" file

   - If you want to train models from scratch, refer to start files in the given order (Navigation section)
